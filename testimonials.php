                                            Working with Jim has been one of the greatest things I have done. . .He has been very patient with me through the journey. Sometimes I didn&#39;t 
                                            understand all the website language, but Jim bore with me. He showed me how to do many things that I didn&#39;t know. 
                                            <br><br>
                                            He was also very honest with me, explaining to me things that I&#39;ve not heard many web designers explain.  Jim doesn&#39;t do website building just to make money but to serve 
                                            people. He gave me access to our website to do things for myself. . .This helps me to be independent and add things to the website whenever I need 
                                            to without having to go through a Web designer. Jim also did more than I requested, exceeding my expectations. 
                                            <br><br>
                                            I am forever grateful to God for bringing him my way. I would recommend him to anyone looking for a great website designer to work with. So far, 
                                            I have heard a lot of compliments from people who have visited our website. 
                                            <br><br>
                                            Thank you so much Jim for helping us out. You are a wonderful person.

                                            If you are considering having your web site created by Jim Burns of Web Media Partners then <strong>you are making an excellent choice.</strong>

                                            Jim completely redesigned AmericanGymTrader.com in just two weeks. Given that we are a database driven site this was no easy task.

                                            We have received numerous compliments from around the country. We <strong>average over three million hits a year</strong> and have the number one listing

                                            As a business owner in need of Internet exposure, <strong>I highly recommend Jim Burns for Web development.</strong>

                                            Mr. Burns is a <strong>delight to work</strong> with and is a skilled wordsmith.

                                            Since engaging Jim to redesign our Web site, we have experienced <strong>exponential growth</strong>.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Proof in the pudding was when a competitor said he wanted to copy our site. 
                                            <br><br>
                                            Mr. Burns has also designed an intricate database content management system with our Company&#39;s growth in mind, which expands the capacity and usefulness of our Web site.

                                            His approach of inquiring on the core values of my company, combining it with my original sketch, and providing alternative ideas based on the information that I 
                                            provided to him resulted in us creating a logo that <strong>far surpassed my expectations!</strong>
