                                Building a Web site is like the sun rising to start a new day. <strong>We build great looking, mobile-first, Web sites</strong> without sacrificing functionality. A web site that isn&#39;t 
                                mobile-first, will not display on all devices, which can lead to losing traffic, prospects and clients.

                                Web development to a Web site is like an Oak tree to an acorn. Web development is the nurtured result that begins as a Web site. It is a living thing with 
                                potential to become something much greater. The site is a seed; its nurtured care is Web development.

                                    The average Web site owner doesn&#39;t always realize that the simplest part of having a successful Web site is getting it built. It&#39;s the reason 
                                    many become disappointed by performance. Unrealistic expectations meet disappointment.

                                    maintenance, because <strong>success demands a lot more than launching a good looking site</strong>. It requires Webmaster, security and marketing duties that

                                Internet marketing includes four marketing channels: <strong>Social Media, Email, Pay-Per-Click and Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</strong>. Each channel or method serves a different 
                                purpose. And similar to conventional marketing, no single medium trumps all others.

                                    A wise strategy employs all channels, with the added benefit of the availability of overwhelming 
                                    amounts of data for analysis that conventional marketing cannot provide. This data acts as a guide to assure that marketing dollars are spent where measured results are the highest,
                                    and not wasted where results are inconsequential. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    For example, Search Engine Optimization&#39;s objective is to increase Web site traffic through <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="SERPs">organic search results</a>. 
                                    Since organic search results are controlled by <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Google, Bing, Yahoo!">search engines</a>, <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Search Engine Optimization"><strong>SEO</strong></a> 
                                    addresses a Web site&#39;s relationship with search engines. Its behind-the-scenes duties include making certain that all data that search engines seek are in place so when the site is crawled 
                                    the right information is stored into their Index. If neglected, your Web site can lose inbound traffic opportunities and not appear in search results for critical keywords. That traffic is going to your competitor. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    <strong>Social Media</strong> 
                                    is a medium through which a business or brand can receive exposure that is disproportionate to cost. For example, a video produced for 
                                    $10,000 going <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Called 'Viral Marketing'">viral</a> might deliver 10, 20 or 100 times its cost in conventional advertising value based on the number of views.
                                    Some attribute &ldquo;branded viral video&rdquo; effectiveness to the fact that YouTube &ldquo;lets brands be more experimental and 
                                    risky&rdquo;(<a href="http://on.mash.to/1kawh6n" target="_blank">Mashable.com</a>) than conventional methods.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <strong><span id="ppc">Email</span></strong> 
                                    is the most direct method to reach clients and prospects with a specific message. There 
                                    are resources available that can guide campaign expectations in terms of open, click and bounce statistics by business size and industry. Automation and ease of production allow
                                    companies who prefer in-house control to cost-effectively produce attractive graphics, schedule deliveries in advance, and examine statistics. Some services provide free 
                                    database (cloud) storage of contact lists and free email delivery (sometimes up to 12,000 per month) with built-in protection against potential

                                    <strong>Pay-Per-Click</strong> 
                                    offers your business the opportunity to appear on page one of search results for specific keywords that your prospects search when looking to buy your services or products. 
                                    But what keywords should you choose? Keyword research can help answer this question and provide insights like keyword effectiveness index (KEI) for potential campaign keywords. 
                                    <strong>KEI</strong> is an evaluation. It is a number that represents the number of pages in Google&#39;s Index in which a keyword appears divided by the 
                                    number of searches that keyword receives in a given period of time (e.g. one month). 
                                    <br><br>
                                    For example, a search in Google of &ldquo;toaster oven&rdquo; reveals that this keyword pair appears in 3,350,000 web pages in Google&#39;s Index. In the US, 
                                    <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Search frequency data available through Google AdWords Keyword Planner Tool">Google reports</a> that &ldquo;toaster oven&rdquo; is 
                                    searched 49,500 times per month. This means that in an average month there are 3,350,000 web pages competing for 49,500 searches.
